Custom EasyApache Modules
=========================

Rather than having to deal with 3rd party Apache modules though multiple after_apache_make_install/posteasyapache hooks it's easier to just have some modules.

In this repo you'll find a bunch of modules, hopefully named in some useful way.

How to install
--------------

    git clone https://github.com/DamianZaremba/easyapache-modules.git
    cd easyapache-modules
    make install
    /scripts/easyapache
